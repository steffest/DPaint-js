Bugs:


Changing the palette color depth squashes all layers?
Transforming a mask clears the layer ?
resizing sizebox negatively, makes the sizebox 0 width/height
resize image to larger doesn't clear all cached data (like the drawlayer?)
copy/paste/undo shortcut doesn't work on Firefox
fill tool is active when scrollbar is clicked
when applying color palette changes - they get applied to the top layer instead of the active layer
scrolling removes selection mask
How to transform layer in touch screens?
Drawing a line over the edge wraps around to the other side
Cropping an image should never enlarge the canvas (if the selection is greater than the canvas)
When resizing the canvas, the selection should be resized as well
drag/drop should import as new layer ?
Transparency settings are not applied on canvas brush
Palette Edit - pick color from image: apply button is not shown
INVERT SELECTION!
Save as Gif - when used in 24-bit alpha image, a black outcome
duplicate colors in palette causes color cycle bugs.



TODO before release:
(why was there a check for "meta key down"? rotate brush stuff?
eydropper should not be active while drawing a line)
