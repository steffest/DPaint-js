<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

<h3>Dude, your effects/filters are not working</h3>

<div class="faq padded">
    You are using safari, right? (or another IOS browser)<br>
    Safari <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter">doesn't support Canvas filters.</a><br>
    I might one day implement them in plain JavaScript, but currently I'm not spending too much time on all the weird and crippling quirks of Safari.

<h3>Dude, When I copy and paste an image, I loose transparency</h3>
<div class="faq padded">
    Yes very often you do...<br>
    This is mainly an issue with Photoshop on Windows, which doesn't save the transparency information in the clipboard in a standard way.<br>
    Weirdly enough, Photoshop on Mac does preserve transparency in copy/paste.<br>
    As a workaround, you can first save your file as PNG and import that instead.

<h3>Dude, what's up with this Deluxe Paint bullsh*t, it's nothing like it.</h3>
<div class="faq padded">
    I mean: the toolbox is even on the wrong side!<br>
    Yep. It's certainly not a remake of Deluxe Paint, but it's heavily inspired by it, regarding Amiga spirit and pixel handling.<br>
    I like to think of as "What if Deluxe Paint was made today?"<br>
    <small>Besides: Deluxe Paint on Atari has the tools at the bottom, blasphemy!</small>

<h3>Can I import palettes from <a href="https://lospec.com/">Lospec</a>?</h3>
<div class="faq padded">
    Yes.<br>
    Download the <a href="https://lospec.com/">Lospec Palette</a> as PNG, open that image in Dpaint.js and select Palette -> From image.
